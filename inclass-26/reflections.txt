• What did you hope to learn but did not?
Interactive websites.

• What did you really enjoy learning about?
How to do backend.

• What worked well in the course? and how?
Lots of work. Need the practice.

• What did not work well in the course and how might it be improved?
Felt like TA's couldn't answer questions. TA's that have taken the class before.

• What could I have done to help you more, presentation of material, design of in class
exercises, goals of projects – and be specific please!
I think the in class lectures were hard to follow, and hard to review because it was mainly images.
It would be nice to have more descriptions alongside the images for students to be able to read it.

• Anything else you like to say?
Kinda wish I can retake it to be able to learn it over again, I felt like there was so much
info that I only really was able to understand and absorb a small portion of it.

	<h2>Singapore</h2>
	<p>I was in Singapore over the summer! The food there is delicious, I ate a ton everyday at the local hawker centres. It is an integral part of Singaporean culture, where people eat outdoors in public food courts daily, drink Kopi-O (coffee with condensed milk), and relax.</p>
	<p>Singapore is a busy city, but the people know how to make living life easy and convenient. The entire island city is sprawling with metro rails, bus lines, and various other forms of public transport. Every other bus station is a multi-storey shopping mall with tons of dining, entertainment, and shopping options. I really wish I can go back!</p>
